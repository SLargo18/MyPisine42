🏊‍♂️ 42 Piscina Projects

The Piscina projects at 42 mark the beginning of my journey into programming in C, focusing on mastering essential technical skills like memory management, data structure manipulation, teamwork, and algorithm optimization. These projects span a wide range of concepts, from low-level programming to solving complex algorithmic challenges. Here are the projects I have worked on so far:

C00 - C06: Fundamentals

📌 Description:
These projects cover the most fundamental aspects of C programming. They include tasks involving pointers, strings, dynamic memory management, and interacting with the operating system. Each project focuses on a specific key skill, building a solid foundation for more advanced projects.

🛠️ Skills Developed:

Pointers and string manipulation.

Dynamic memory management.

Low-level problem solving.

Basic optimization and error handling.

shell00: Basic Unix Shell

📌 Description:
In this project, I implemented a simplified version of a Unix shell. The goal was to create an environment where users could execute basic Unix commands like ls, pwd, and others without requiring a full operating system.

🛠️ Skills Developed:

Process management in C (fork, exec, wait).

Command execution environment creation.

Filesystem interaction.

Error handling and signal management.

shell01: Advanced Unix Shell

📌 Description:
The second version of the shell included more advanced features such as pipe handling (|), input/output redirection (>, <), and background command execution. This project reinforced my system programming skills and deepened my understanding of process management.

🛠️ Skills Developed:

Advanced process and signal handling.

Pipe and redirection implementation.

Modular software design.

Error management and optimization.
