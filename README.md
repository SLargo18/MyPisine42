# 🏊‍♂️ 42 Piscina Projects

The **Piscina projects** at **42** mark the beginning of my journey into programming in C, focusing on mastering essential technical skills like memory management, data structure manipulation, teamwork, and algorithm optimization. These projects span a wide range of concepts, from low-level programming to solving complex algorithmic challenges. Here are the projects I have worked on so far:

---

## C00 - C06: Fundamentals

### 📌 Description:
These projects cover the most fundamental aspects of C programming. They include tasks involving pointers, strings, dynamic memory management, and interacting with the operating system. Each project focuses on a specific key skill, building a solid foundation for more advanced projects.

### 🛠️ Skills Developed:
- Pointers and string manipulation.
- Dynamic memory management.
- Low-level problem solving.
- Basic optimization and error handling.

## 🖥️ shell00: Basic Unix Shell

### 📌 Description:
In this project, I created a basic Unix shell in C that simulates a simplified command line interface. The shell can execute commands like `ls`, `pwd`, and others by using **fork** and **exec** system calls. It also handles basic error checking and waits for the processes to finish.

The goal was to understand how the Unix shell works behind the scenes and practice working with processes in C.

### 🛠️ Skills Developed:
- Process management in C using `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`.
- Implementing a command execution environment.
- Handling basic shell commands and user input.
- Basic error handling and exit status management.

## 🖥️ shell01: Advanced Unix Shell

### 📌 Description:
In **shell01**, the focus was on expanding the functionality of the shell to handle more complex features like **pipes**, **input/output redirection**, and **background processes**.

The shell can now execute commands like `ls | grep file`, redirect outputs to files (`>`, `<`), and manage background processes using the `&` operator. The project deepened my understanding of Unix system calls, process management, and I/O redirection.

### 🛠️ Skills Developed:
- Advanced process management using `fork` and `exec`.
- Implementing pipes (`|`) and redirections (`>`, `<`).
- Managing background processes with `&`.
- Handling errors and edge cases in a Unix-like environment.
- Implementing a more modular shell design.
