# 🏊‍♂️ 42 Piscina Projects

The **Piscina projects** at **42** mark the beginning of my journey into programming in C, focusing on mastering essential technical skills like memory management, data structure manipulation, teamwork, and algorithm optimization. These projects span a wide range of concepts, from low-level programming to solving complex algorithmic challenges. Here are the projects I have worked on so far:

---

## C00 - C06: Fundamentals

### 📌 Description:
These projects cover the most fundamental aspects of C programming. They include tasks involving pointers, strings, dynamic memory management, and interacting with the operating system. Each project focuses on a specific key skill, building a solid foundation for more advanced projects.

### 🛠️ Skills Developed:
- Pointers and string manipulation.
- Dynamic memory management.
- Low-level problem solving.
- Basic optimization and error handling.

## 🖥️ shell00: Basic Unix Shell

### 📌 Description:
In **shell00**, I implemented a basic Unix shell in C, following the project guidelines. The goal was to create a simple shell that could execute basic commands (like `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.) by reading user input and executing the appropriate commands using **system calls**. The shell also includes basic error handling to ensure that commands are properly executed.

This project helped me understand how a shell works on a fundamental level, including basic command execution and error checking.

### 🛠️ Skills Developed:
- Reading user input and parsing commands.
- Executing basic shell commands.
- Handling basic error checking and user input validation.
- Understanding the basic structure of a Unix shell.

## 🖥️ shell01: Advanced Unix Shell

### 📌 Description:
In **shell01**, I expanded the basic shell from **shell00** to include additional functionality like input/output redirection (using `>` and `<`). The shell can now execute commands while redirecting their input or output to/from files. The project involved parsing user input to detect these redirections and adjust the behavior of the shell accordingly.

This project helped me improve my understanding of how to manage file descriptors and implement simple redirection in a shell.

### 🛠️ Skills Developed:
- Implementing input/output redirection (`>`, `<`).
- Parsing user input for redirection operators.
- Handling file descriptors for redirection.
- Improving error handling and managing edge cases.
